System Integration
====================================

By this point, we'll assume a Neural Network model has been already [trained](../tensorflow_training/) and [optimized](../tensorrt/). However, before running the python script to perform online inference with the [Tau2 camera](../CAD/), we need to install a kernel module to the Jetson Xavier to interface with the camera.
