# Documentation

## Introduction 

- This document covers the systems architecture related work for this project. It consists of interface diagram, requirements engineering, stakeholder analysis and functional safety analysis. 
- The goal of all this analyses is to ensure that the project scope stays feasible and relevant within the project timeline. 
- The functional safety analysis is a direct requirement of the stakeholders as well. 
- The interface diagram depicts the interactions between the various sub-systems - pre-processing, software and hardware. 

## Scope of the project

- The project scope is primarily limited to achieving inference of the mentioned classes from the object detection system.
- Additionally, outputting the inference in a standard format (as per the stakeholder requirements) so that it can be used further to control the relevant actuators is also within the scope of the project.
- Developing robust mounting systems for the camera and Jetson Xavier using 3D-printing is also an important part and lies within the project scope.
