| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AI in Motion            | Make a car that is capable of driving autonomously during night-time and bad weather conditions |
| Gijs Dubbelman          | Get a view about feasibility of driving autonomously using object detection systems based on thermal imaging principles |
| Participants in traffic | Not collide with the autonomous vehicle in traffic           |
| Pavol Jancura           | Project owner. Ensure that Gijs' concerns are met regarding the project |
| FLIR                    | Selling thermal cameras is FLIRs concern. They provide labelled thermal images which can be used for training so more companies will use their cameras for development purposes. |
| TU/e                    | Facilitating PDEng trainees and public relations (marketing, support interesting and promising projects) |
| ISO                     | People use their standards will give them status to other companies |
| Daan de Geus            | Acknowledgement of good help from us to his professor        |
| Anweshan Das            | Acknowledgement of good help from us to his professor        |
| Navinfo                 | Increase their share on the autonomous driving market        |
| Tijs van der Smagt      | Facilitate projects and have additional systems working on the vehicle which increase its detection capabilities |
| NVIDIA                  | Selling cutting edge computing platforms that enables embedded AI for deploying for example neural networks to use for computer vision purposes |
| Government              | Safety of the road users                                     |
