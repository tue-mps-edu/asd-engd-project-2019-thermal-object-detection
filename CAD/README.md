# Design and Manufacturing of Moutning Brackets.

## Jetson Xavier mounting bracket

To mount the Xavier on the car, initially we considered multiple candidate locations. For example, we considered mounting it on the car's roof and besides the camera so that we don't require long USB cable to connect the two. But after having a discussion with the stakeholders, we decided that mounting it inside the car was a more safer and elegant option since we will be eliminating any risk of the Xavier being exposed to external ambient conditions. The pre-installed base plate located in the boot space of the car was selected as the most appropriate location to mount Jetson Xavier after discussing with the stakeholders. This is so because there is no need to make any water-resistant design of the mounting bracket for this mounting location. This implies a simpler design with less manufacturing time and cost.
The design consists of a simple rectangular mounting plate of 8 mm thickness with provision of holes at the appropriate locations. The base plate has holes of 5 mm diameter and spaced 50 mm apart in a grid format. Accordingly, the length and breadth of the mounting plate was calculated to be 170 mm and 120 mm respectively. Four holes of 5.4 mm diameter (considering a manufacturing tolerance of 0.4 mm) were provided on the mounting plate spaced 150 mm apart lengthwise and 100 mm apart breadthwise.To mount the Jetson Xavier on the mounting plate, another 4 holes of 3.4 mm diameter were provided with correct spacing amongst them (based on the actual measured data of distance between the mounting screws of the Xavier). Correspondingly, longer screws were procured to account for the thickness of the mounting plate. Additionally, some material from the central portion of the mounting plate was saved by providing a circular hole of 55 mm diameter. This helped in lesser manufacturing time and cost without affecting the strength and functionality of the mounting plate.

## Thermal camera mounting bracket

To mount the thermal camera on the car, we basically had two options. One of them was to mount it like the way the RGB camera was mounted inside the car just behind the windshield. But due to lack of enough space in that location and also since it's not recommended to have any glass between the camera and the objects it's supposed to detect, we decided to go ahead with the other option of mounting it on the false roof of the car. The front left portion of the false roof of the car was selected as the most appropriate location to mount the thermal camera after discussion with the stakeholders. This is so because there was no other feasible location available. Also, there is a provision (by means of threaded holes on the false roof) to mount the bracket on the false roof.
The design consists of a simple rectangular mounting plate of 8 mm thickness with provision of a central enclosure to assemble the camera as well as holes and cavities at the appropriate locations. These holes and cavities are there for specific reasons - for example, four holes of 2.4 mm diameter on the side walls of the enclosure to mount the camera with the help of the procured M2 mounting screws; four holes of 6 mm diameter on the mounting plate spaced 113.45 mm lengthwise and 99 mm breadthwise to mount the mounting plate on the false roof; a rectangular cavity on one side wall of the enclosure to account for the USB cable connection with the camera; a circular hole of 30 mm diameter on the front wall of the enclosure to account for the camera lens and help in mounting the camera on the enclosure via the locking ring. Additionally, a rectangular cavity was provided on the top face of the mounting plate to accommodate the small 3 mm protrusion on the bottom face of the camera. Also, the entire enclosure was made inclined upward at 5.6 degrees with respect to the horizontal direction to account for the slope of flase roof at mounting location.
