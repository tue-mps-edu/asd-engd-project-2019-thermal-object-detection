# mAP evaluation code 

- Open the anaconda command prompt(virtual environment), the code should be run in the following virtual environment   

  ​    

  ```
  $ activate virtual environment
  $ activate tf1_12_gpu
  ```

  

- Copy the python eval.py file from the legacy folder and paste it where you have your checkpoints and pipeline_config_path saved(folder).

- Run the below code in the virtual environment to get mAP score for entire dataset and each class in both tensorboard and command prompt.

  ```
  
  $ python eval.py --logtostderr --checkpoint_dir=model_for_training/ --  	eval_dir=evaluation/ --pipeline_config_path=model_for_training/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco.config
  ```



where,

`checkpoint_ dir` = This is the directory where you have your checkpoint meta file which is saved at the end of your training simulation.

`eval_dir`= This the directory where you want your mAP scores to be saved.

`pipeline_config_path=` This is the directory which contains your network configuration file. E.g. ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco.config which you have modified according to your requirement's before training the dataset.
